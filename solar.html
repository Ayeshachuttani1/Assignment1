    <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[9] It was formed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is an ordinary main sequence star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere.

        The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

<h2>Mercury</h2>
<img src="mercury.jpg" height="200px">
<p>The smallest and fastest planet, Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and whips around it every 88 Earth days.</p>
<h2>Venus</h2>
<img src="venus.jpg" height="200px">
<p>It has a reflective, whitish atmosphere that is mainly composed of carbon dioxide. At the surface, the atmospheric pressure is ninety times as dense as on Earth's sea level. Venus is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 째C (752 째F), mainly due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.The planet lacks a protective magnetic field, which suggests that its atmosphere is sustained by volcanic activity.Its surface displays extensive evidence of volcanic activity but devoid of plate tectonics. Venus has no natural satellites.</p>
<h2>Earth</h2>
<img src="Earth.jpg" height="200px">
<p> It is the only place in the universe where life and surface liquid water known to exist.[98] Earth's atmosphere contains 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, which is the result of the presence of life. The planet has a complex climate and weather system, with drastically different conditions between climate regions. The solid surface of Earth is dominated by green vegetation, deserts and white ice sheets.Earth's planetary magnetosphere shields the surface from radiation, limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining life habitability.</p>
<h2>Mars</h2>
<img src="mars.jpg" height="200px">
<p>It has a radius about half of that of Earth.Most of the planet is red due to iron oxide in Martian soil, and the polar regions is covered in white ice caps made of water and carbon dioxide. Mars has an atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide and surface pressure 0.6% of that of Earth, which is sufficient to support some weather phenomena. Its surface is peppered with volcanoes and rift valleys, and has a rich collection of minerals. Mars have a highly differentiated internal structure and have lost its magnetosphere 4 billion years ago. Mars have two tiny moons: Phobos and Deimos.</p>
<h2>Jupiter</h2>
<img src="Jupiter.jpg" height="200px">
<p>It is the biggest and most massive planet in the Solar System. It is mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. On the surface, there are orange-brown and white cloud bands moving via the law of atmospheric circulation, with giant storms swirling on the surface such as the Great Red Spot and various white 'ovals'. Jupiter possesses a very strong magnetosphere, enough to redirect ionizing radiation and cause auroras on the poles.As of 2024, Jupiter has 95 confirmed satellites</p>
<h2>Saturn</h2>
<img src="Saturn.jpg" height="200px">
<p>It has a distinctive visible ring system orbiting around its equator, which is composed of small ice and rock particles. Like Jupiter, it is mostly made of hydrogen and helium. At the north and south poles, Saturn has peculiar hexagon-shaped storms larger than the diameter of Earth, rotating around themselves every 10.5 hours. Saturn has a magnetosphere capable of producing weak auroras. As of 2024, Saturn has 146 confirmed satellites</p>
<h2>Uranus</h2>
<img src="Uranus.jpg" height="200px">
<p>It is unique among the planets, orbits the Sun on its side as its axial tilt is >90째. This gives the planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole points toward and then away from the Sun. Uranus's outer layer has a muted cyan color, but underneath these clouds are many mysteries about its climate phenomena, such as Uranus's peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph), polar cap variations, erratic cloud formation and unusually low internal heat. As of 2024, Uranus has 28 confirmed satellites</p>
<h2>Neptune</h2>
<img src="neptune.jpg" height="200px">
<p>It is the furthest planet known in the Solar System. Its outer atmosphere has a slightly muted cyan color, with occasional storms on the surface that looks like dark spots. Like Uranus, many atmospheric phenomena of Neptune are still unexplained, such as the thermosphere's abnormally high temperature or the strong tilt (47째) of its magnetosphere. Models suggest that Neptune might have hailstone-like diamonds deep in its atmosphere. As of 2024, Neptune has 16 confirmed satellites</p>
